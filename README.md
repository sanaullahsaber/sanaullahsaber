#ðŸ‘‹Hello, I'm Sanaullah Saber
![](https://i.postimg.cc/9f3yNyVN/github.png)

I specialize in building mobile responsive front-end UI applications that connect with APIs and other backend technologies. Iâ€™m passionate about learning new technologies and understand that there is more than one way to accomplish a task. Though I am most proficient in building front-end applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, I am a quick learner and can pick up new tech stacks as needed. The mark of a skilled developer isn't language mastery, but the ability to pick the right tool from the developer's toolbox.
